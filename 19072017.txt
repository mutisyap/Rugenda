DJANGO VIEWS
Take an http request, return http response
It should take a request object as the first argument

e.g 
from django.http import HttpResponse
def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World")

Class based views:
subclasses View and implements methods for the HTTP methods it supports. 


from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views.generic import View

class MyView(View):

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, World")
