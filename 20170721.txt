@Component
Annotation marks a java class as a bean so the component-scanning mechanism of spring can
pick it up and pull it into the application context.

@Repository
Similar to @Component in use and functionality additionally it  it also makes the unchecked 
exceptions (thrown from DAO methods) eligible for translation into Spring DataAccessException.

@Service
also a specialization of the component annotation. It doesn’t currently provide any additional 
behavior over the @Component annotation, but it’s a good idea to use @Service over @Component
in service-layer classes because it specifies intent better. Additionally, tool support and 
additional behavior might rely on it in the future.

@Controller
Marks a class as a Spring Web MVC controller. It too is a @Component specialization, so beans 
marked with it are automatically imported into the DI container. When you add the @Controller 
annotation to a class, you can use another annotation i.e. @RequestMapping; to map URLs to 
instance methods of a class.
