Component Definition Object (CDO for short).

The expressions in curly braces ({{phone.name}} and {{phone.snippet}}) denote bindings, 
which are referring to our application model,

(since components are also directives) the name of the component is in camelCase (e.g. 
myAwesomeComponent), but we will use kebab-case (e.g. my-awesome-component) when referring to it in our HTML.

 it is considered a good practice to avoid using the scope directly.
